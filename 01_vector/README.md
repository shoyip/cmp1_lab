# Vector3D

## Goal

Design and implement a C++ class with name `Vector3D` to handle mathematical
operations involving vectors in $\mathbb{R}^3$.

## Features

- [x] Pick appropriate data members
- [x] Implement constructors of all kinds you think may be of use
- [x] Implement setters
- [x] Implement member functions `scalarProduct()`, `vectorProduct()`, `magnitude()`, `theta()` and `phi()`
- [ ] Implement the function `angle()` to calculate and return the angle between two vectors
- [ ] Overload operators `+`, `-` and `=`
- [ ] Overload operators `*` and `/` so that you can multiply or divide a vector by a double
- [ ] Ensure you can handle both spherical and cartesian coordinate systems

## Design

## Compilation and Use

Issue the following command to compile the program.

```console
$ g++ Vector3D.cpp -o vector
```
